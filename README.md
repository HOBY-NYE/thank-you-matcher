_Thank You Matcher_ creates a pairing of student attendees to one of the annual [Hugh O'Brian Youth](http://hoby.org) 
(HOBY) seminars and the sponsors, donors, and organizations that have contributed. Because each seminar is fully 
organized, staffed, and funded by volunteers; these sponsorships and donations help to enable students from all walks 
of life to attend. By having the students write these generous people and groups a personalized Thank-You shows our 
commitment to making future leaders.
